<!-- Since the modals are just states, you get all the other added benefits of the Angular UI Router, including:

    Nested states – You can render other states within your modals
    Callbacks – Fire off events when your modal opens or closes to inform other parts of your application
    State params and dependency injection – Pass data to your modals with state params
    or dependency inject data services into your state’s controllers
    URLs – States are URI routable meaning you could have a URL that links to a modal, pretty nifty   -->
