<!--  The ngOptions attribute can be used to dynamically generate a list of <option> elements for the <select>
element using the array or object obtained by evaluating the ngOptions comprehension expression. -->

<!-- Advantages over ngRepeat like not creating a new scope for each repeated instance ,
    more flexibility in how the <select>'s model is assigned via the select as part of the comprehension expression. -->


<!-- Note: ngOptions provides an iterator facility for the ‘option’ element which should be used
    instead of ngRepeat when you want the select model to be bound to a non-string value.
    This is because an option element can only be bound to string values at present.

    When an item in the <select> menu is selected, the array element or object property represented by
    the selected option will be bound to the model identified by the ngModel directive.
    -->

<div ng-controller="Test">

    <p>selected item is : {{selectedItem}}</p>
    <p> age of selected item is : {{selectedItem.age}} </p>

    <!--Now the selectedItem is bound to an object instead of the string value-->
    <!--By default, ngModel watches the model by reference, not value.
    This is important when binding any input directive to a model that is an object or a collection.-->
    <select ng-model="selectedItem" ng-options="item.name for item in items">
    </select>

        var app = angular.module('app',[]);
        app.controller('Test',function($scope){
            $scope.items = [{name: 'one', age: 30 },{ name: 'two', age: 27 },{ name: 'three', age: 50 }];
            $scope.selectedItem = $scope.items[0];
        });
